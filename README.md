* Surveys should be conducted in other countries apart from the United State and some parts in Australia to understand their customer pains and preferences and the feedback gotten from the survey will be used to analyse all what the customers in that region wanted.
* Maintaining positive customer experience to retain existing customers and encourage repeat purchases. This could include discounts on accessories, maintenance services, or exclusive offers for loyal customers.
* Social media accounts could be considered to build brand awareness, engage with customers, and promote loyalty program benefits. Some advertisemnet method could be targeted at other countries other than United States or even all the countries to improve sales.
